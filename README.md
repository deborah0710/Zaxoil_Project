## Project Overview
This data cleaning and analysis project aims to explore key insights about employee distribution, staffing and salary trends in order to we aim to uncover patterns in hiring, salary variations, tenure, and growth—helping guide strategic decision-making for the company’s future.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis was obtained from the database, "zaxoil.db", containing detailed information about each employee in the company.

### Tools
- SQL- Data cleaning and analysis

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Data inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?
What is the distribution of employees across departments (e.g., Drilling, Finance, Engineering)?
4. How does salary vary by position, department, and location?
5. Are there any trends in the hiring dates based on departments or positions?
6. What is the relationship between staff positions and supervisors?
7. How do salaries compare between employees based on their job locations (e.g., Offshore vs. Onshore)?
8. What is the average tenure of employees across different departments or positions?
9. How do gender or role (e.g., Engineers vs. Technicians) impact the salary distribution?
10. What is the headcount distribution across different staff levels (Managers, Supervisors, Technicians)?
11. How does the hiring timeline reflect the company's growth and staffing needs?
12. What role does the supervisor hierarchy play in staffing decisions and salary structures?
